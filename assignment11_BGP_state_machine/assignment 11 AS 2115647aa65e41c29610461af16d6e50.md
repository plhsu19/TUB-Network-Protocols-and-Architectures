    1. AS name: CDU-AS-AP Charles Darwin University, AU
    2. AS number: 58611
2. From the output of the above command, please copy only the **Active Route** to your solution.
Do not include alternative routes.
    1. lookup AS server's ip address (not necessary)

        ```bash

        - -t: specify query name
    2. telnet connection to the route server

        ```bash
        telnet route-server.as3257.net
        ```

    3. show route to 138.80.10.69 (www.cdu.edu.au)

        ```bash
        show route 138.80.10.69

        138.80.0.0/16      *[BGP/170] 1w0d 08:33:43, MED 10, localpref 100, from 213.200.87.119

1. reservation state: soft-state, it terminates (transition occurs) because of time-out.

    available state:  hard-state, transition is triggered upon receiving the reservation msg from the sender.

    ![assignment%2011%20AS%202115647aa65e41c29610461af16d6e50/Untitled.png](assignment%2011%20AS%202115647aa65e41c29610461af16d6e50/Untitled.png)

2. in-use state: could be **soft state** with **explicit removal**.

    ![assignment%2011%20AS%202115647aa65e41c29610461af16d6e50/Untitled%201.png](assignment%2011%20AS%202115647aa65e41c29610461af16d6e50/Untitled%201.png)

    the state starts because of the usage from the sender/client, and terminates when the sender stops using the car. The terminate (transition) could be triggered by the explicit action, i.e., message to terminate the renting, from the client/sender. It can also be triggered because the car is idle for a fixed time without being used, i.e., without receiving actively using message from the user.

3. How would the service change if the system were using only soft states or only hard states?
    - Only hard state: The reserved state can only be terminated upon receiving the "teardown" message from the user. In this case, the service will not be able to stops the exploitation caused by the long reservation time because it lacks "timeout" mechanics. And the car can returns to "available state" only when the user explicitly states the termination. Although it is not perfect, the service can still work.
    - Only soft state: The in-use car will automatically transfers to the "available state" once the car is idle for a fixed time, which makes sense because it can release the car back to "available" once it is idle for a fixed time. However, the car in "available state" will also transferred to "reserved state" once it is available over a fixed time, which is totally non-sense.
