**Question1:**

1. DNS record type:
    - A: domain name of a host, Ipv4
    - AAAA: domain of a host, IPv6
    - CNAME: alias host name of a server, canonical host name of the server
    - MX: alias host name of a mail server, canonical host name of the mail server
    - NS: domain, the host name of the authoritative DNS server the knows the IP addresses of hosts who under the domain
2. dig the IPs for www.heise.de

    ```bash
    dig @<IP address of resolver> <website> -t <query_type>
    dig @8.8.8.8 www.heise.de -t A
    dig @8.8.8.8 www.heise.de -t AAAA

    // log for DNS record type A
    ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @8.8.8.8 duckduckgo.com -t A
    ; (1 server found)
    ;; global options: +cmd

3. use dig to query the IPv4 for [duckduck.com](http://duckduck.com) several times:
    - I got the same ip address in all responses
    - According to the TA, there should be various addresses in responses because of the load balancing. —> balance the requests over multiple servers

**Question2:**

(a) Telnet into a Web server and send a valid HTTP/ 1.1 request message!4 Include *in* the request

message the If-modified-since: header line to force a response message with the 304 Not

Modified status code. Include a full log of the telnet session *in* your solution.

```bash
telnet example.com 80

# log of telnet session:

Trying 93.184.216.34...

Connected to example.com.

Escape character is '^]'.

GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: example.com

```

(b) Telnet into the same or a different Web server and send a valid HTTP / 1.1 request message!

Construct your request *in* a way to force a response message with the 404 Not Found status

code. Include a log of the telnet session *in* your solution. Do not include the body

of the response!

```bash
telnet example.com 80

# log of telnet session:

Trying 93.184.216.34...

Connected to example.com.

Escape character is '^]'.

GET /file-not-exist.html HTTP/1.1

```

(c) Assume that a Web server at http://example.org hosts a file called index.html, which is a Web page with two pictures: http://images.example.org/logo.png and http://images. example.org/hello.jpg. The pictures are hosted on another server than the index page. One day, the admin accidentally deletes hello.jpg. Now, a Web client loads this page, using persistent HTTP/1.1. What HTTP messages does the client send and receive? Provide at least the methods, necessary headers, and status codes.

1. HTTP request message for index.html and response from server "example.org" with persistent HTTP:

    ```bash
    # client requests index.html from server "example.org" with persistent HTTP:
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.org
    Connection: Keep-Alive

    # the response from the server:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```

2. HTTP request messages for logo.png and hello.jpg and responses from server "images.example.org" with persistent  HTTP:

    ```bash
    # client requests logo.png from server "images.example.org" with persistent HTTP:
    GET /logo.png HTTP/1.1
    Host: images.example.org
    Connection: keep-alive

    # the response from the server:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: keep-alive

    # client requests the missing hello.jpg from server "images.example.org" with persistent HTTP:
    GET /hello.jpg HTTP/1.1
    Host: images.example.org
    Connection: keep-alive

    # the response from the server:
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```

(d) Please explain persistent HTTP with pipelining, and persistent HTTP without pipelining. What is the difference between them? What is the advantage and disadvantage of pipelining?

- persistent HTTP without pipeline:

    The client and server reuse the same TCP connection for multiple request/response transactions, the server will not terminate the TCP connection after it response to the client. The connection session time or maximum transaction numbers are negotiated by client and server. The request is sent sequentially once the client received the response for the previous request, which means each request takes one complete RTT.

- persistent HTTP with pipeline: Similar as persistent HTTP without pipeline, the server keeps the TCP connection alive after sending responses. Same TCP connection is used for several request/response transactions. The difference is that the client can send multiple requests without waiting for the responses from the server, and the server will response in the same order as the requests sent by the client.
- Advantage of pipeline: Pipeline can save the time of waiting for a whole RTT before sending the next request/response. Becasue the time between sending out requests/responses is usually much shorter than a RTT, pipeline can save a huge amount of time by enabling client/server to send and receive multiple requests/responses nearly at the same time.
- Disadvantage of pipeline:
    1. Pipeline was introduced after HTTP/1.1, therefore older servers do not support this feature. Pipeline is often turned off defaultly because older version of servers cannot response correctly if client using pipeline to send the requests.
    2. Head-of-line blocking (HOL blocking): As the server needs to send the responses **in the same order** as the requests, the requests that take too much processing time could block the whole pipeline. That means, the later responses can only be processed and sent after the processing of the previous time-consuming request is finished, which may lead the long total wating time to receive all the responses.
    
**Question3: average hops needed**

1. 1 hop
2. star topology
    1. center intermediary node: 2
    2. center node is also an end node: 

        for the center node: 1

        for all other node to another none-center node: 2

        for all other node to the center node: 1

        —> (2m -2) / 2

3. ring topology: 
    1. unidirectional: n/2 
    2. bidirectional: 
        - n is even:  n^2/ (4n - 4)
        - n is odd: (n + 1) / 4
